        <div class="rightField">MatrixMath is a utilitarian C++ based mathematics program designed as an alternative to MATLAB, Labview, Mathematica, or other similar
            computer algebra programs.  The program has several planned features such as graphing, matrix operations, symbolic algebra, graphing, and more.  It is still in the
            pre-alpha development stage, and consists of about 15.3k lines of code.  The program has been rebuilt from the ground up three times since initial development.  The program
            utilizes the Eigen library to handle matrix/vector calculations, and includes an implementation of the Atlas of Finite Group Representations.  In addition, a modern OpenGL-based graphing
            system was also implemented, enabling users to view and manipulate graphs of calculated functions, matrices, vectors, vector fields, surfaces, geometric objects, and other mathematical objects.

        <div class="rightField">TOPO is an extension of a piece of software I developed for the purpose of rendering models of Riemann Surfaces for a lecture at the University of Lethbridge.
            It is a C++ based rendering engine capable of rendering a wide variety of file formats (.obj, .3ds, .dwg, .blend, and many more).
            Ideal for 3D modeling, gaming, CAD modeling, and a host of other purposes, TOPO is intended to be versatile software that is both fluid and powerful.
            The program is still currently under development, but an early demo is soon to be completed.
